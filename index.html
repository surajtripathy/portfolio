  <h2>My Story:</h2>
  <div id="about-container">
    <div id="my-story">
      <p>I'm an Computer Engineering masters student at the Stony Brook University with notable experience in computer science and programming. I really enjoy learning new things and I'm always open to new ideas and projects.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I have also co-authored a paper in the TENCON 2019 studying the role of temporal diversity in inferring social ties based on spatio-temporal data. <a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8929637 onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline';"

      <br>
      <p>I’ve used various flavors of Linux on the desktop: Pop!_OS, Elementary OS, Ubuntu… In the end I realized that once the OS is set up and configured, I spend most of my time in bash and they are all pretty much the same. My current development machine is a MacBook Air, the first Mac I’ve owned. With the help of Homebrew and Vagrant, it’s a suitable Linux replacement with a very nice form factor.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As far as programming languages, I have had a lot of opportunity to experiment – creating large scale applications in Python, Java, and .NET, and dabbling with PHP, Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Verilog, shell scripting, Scala, and others. At the moment, my weapon of choice is Python. It took me a while to get over the idea that whitespace is significant, but now firing up an editor and looking at Python code feels like a breath of fresh air compared to more verbose languages like Java.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am a world citizen. Living in two different cultures and traveling in unfamiliar places has changed my perspective on what it means to be a person and a caretaker of the Earth.</p>
